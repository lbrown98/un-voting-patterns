    "\n",
    "### **United Nations Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded immediately after World War II. The purpose of the UN is to maintain international peace and security, provide humanitarian assistance to those in need, protect human rights, and promote economic development. It pursues these goals through several bodies, including:\n",
    "* the General Assembly, the main deliberative body, which includes one seat for each recognized member-state. Many committees and subcommittees help to form and inform policies within their specific jurisdictions that may be considered by the GA;\n",
    "* the Security Council, a body comprised of 15 member states, including 5 permanent members, which is tasked with dealing with threats to international peace and security;\n",
    "* the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which settles international legal disputes between countries and gives advice to the UN when requested; and \n",
    "* the Secretariat, which consists of staff from all over the world and carries out the day to day operations of the UN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Background Readings**\n",
    "For more information regarding:\n",
    "* the founding and history of the United Nations: [click here](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/united-nations).\n",
    "* the structure of the United Nations, [click here](https://guides.lib.fsu.edu/c.php?g=946756&p=6852483).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project and methodology were based on a similar one tracking the change in Congress partisanship over time, which you can read more on [here](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/97109/Andris-2015-The%20rise%20of%20partisan.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial looks at how countries in the United Nations vote with respect to other countries. We ask the question, as countries rise and fall, how do UN voting patterns shift, if at all? How do voting blocs form and dissipate over time? If we can discover which countries are at the center of voting blocs, we may be able to determine which countries will be most able to influence the outcomes of UN resolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will follow the data science pipeline which includes the steps of data collection, data processing, analysis, and insight & policy decision. To do this, we use an adjacency matrix to create graphs, in order to determine how similarly countries vote compared to each other and visualize how voting blocs have formed and changed over time. We hypothesize that as countries rise and fall from power, clusters will form and dissolve around these countries. The null hypothesis, then, is that there is no relationship between any voting blocs that may form and the rise and fall of countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the countries we are interested in for this dataset are the United States, the Soviet Union, and China. These three countries have been major world players since the founding of the United Nations, and while we will be looking for the center of voting blocs regardless of who it may be, these three countries will be highlighted throughout our data exploration and analysis.

    "### **UN Subjects** \n",
    "\n",
    "The United Nations keeps all its resolution data on their [digital library website](https://digitallibrary.un.org/), in which anyone can search through any resolution, speech, or any other document from the UN. After filtering to just [General Assembly voting data](https://digitallibrary.un.org/search?ln=en&cc=Voting%20Data&p=&f=&rm=&ln=en&sf=&so=d&rg=50&c=Voting%20Data&c=&of=hb&fti=0&fct__2=General%20Assembly&fti=0&fct__2=General%20Assembly&fct__9=Vote), there are almost 7000 resolutions from 1946 to 2022. For the first step of the Data Science Pipeline, data collection, we will be gathering data from this site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no API provided by the UN to easily access or filter all of the resolution data, we had to resort to scraping necessary data off of each resolution's webpage. Scraping is the process of using a bot to extract content and data from a website, so that we don't have to do it manually for each resolution. To determine which resolutions we wanted to use for our dataset, we decided to utilize the UN library website's ability to filter by different subjects to access certain resolutions. There are hundreds of subjects to filter by, some of which are contained within broader subjects. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw no way to get around manually filtering through the subjects, and we placed each subject into the following broader categories of our own design: \n",
    "* International Peacekeeping/Security, and Weapons Agreements: Includes any resolutions about wars and conflicts (civil, between countries, etc), weapons agreements (nuclear, chemical, IAEA notes), security agreements, cybersecurity, post-war international judicial courts (ICJ/ICTY/ICTR), terrorism, Hostage-taking during wars, and more.\n",
    "* Internal UN functioning: Includes budgets and resolutions discussing the functioning of the UN as a whole\n",
    "* Economic: Includes any international economic treaties, economic rights of countries, and global trade\n",
    "* Development: Includes human issues that the development status of a country might affect (like health), resolutions directly related to a country's development (infrastructure, development towards a specific country, etc.), and decolonization \n",
    "* Sustainability/environment: Includes any resolutions that may be related to climate change or how the environment has affected humans\n",
    "* Human Rights/Humanitarian: Includes humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, human rights questions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "When determining which categories to use, we decided not to use international peacekeeping/security and weapons agreements, or internal functioning resolutions, because at the time we believed that there would not be enough disparity between countries in these resolutions, and that the inclusion of these resolutions may neutralize the other data we collected.[<sup>*</sup>](#fn1) We also were interested in development and human rights resolutions, and chose to include the other categories since they all either were directly related to this or were so influential to these topics that they could not be separated from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "After deciding on which categories to use, we still had over a hundred subjects to include in our dataset. As a final way of filtering, we chose a spread of subjects from each category that had the most number of resolutions in their category; this way, we could get the maximum \"bang for our buck\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn1\"><sup>*</sup></span>We have since found this to be somewhat of an error, since not only does our data visualization program account for these types of similarities but also many countries may disagree on country-specific resolutions related to international security. We discuss a bit more about this in our final notes at the very end of the project. "

    "Code-wise, the first thing we needed to do was get a link to each resolution. We had already created csv files beforehand to store the links, so we simply read in each csv. While performing all our scraping, it was important to save all the data as we did it in case our program crashed or cut off, especially since our scraping permissions were unconfirmed by the UN. By always saving the resolution urls we scraped and ensuring that we also kept track of which subjects we visited, we ensured that we would never have to visit a website more than once and no data would be lost.

Each individual entry in this table is a country's vote for a specific resolution. The second dataframe stored extra information about each resolution that would be helpful to us when visualizing and analyzing our data; each row in this dataframe was a resolution ID, and the other two columns were the name and year of the resolution.

    "Resolutions in the General Assembly may be voting or non-voting resolutions. For any given voting resolution, a country may vote Yay, Nay, Abstain, or not be present and thus not vote. While the meaning of Yay and Nay are fairly straightforward, the reasons behind abstentions or absences are less so. Countries usually abstain for political reasons; for example, one may abstain from a resolution rebuking a nation because while they recognize the wrongdoing, that nation is an ally. They may also abstain from a resolution that may otherwise force them to choose between an ally and strong trading partner, for instance. A country may not be present for a vote for a variety of reasons, from the representative being unwell to intentionally protesting against the vote. In general, not being present for a vote is often similar to abstaining, but without even wanting to be on record as formally abstaining by avoiding the vote altogether. (The joke is that representatives deliberately go to the bathroom during the vote!) It's difficult to generalize the specific reasons behind these two responses, which will come into play later during our data analysis. \n",

    "We initially intended on using a k-means clustering algorithm for this project to plot the datapoints, hoping it would give us a simlar graphic to [this one](https://github.com/lbrown98/un-voting-patterns/blob/main/partainship-graph-inspiration-vox.png) from the study this project was based on. However, we quickly ran into a dimensionality problem, and even when we tried to tidy the data by refactoring it into three columns (country, resolution, vote) it was still one dimension too many to display it the way we wanted to. We also found the method to be difficult to encode, as the k means algorithm asks for numerical input which would require us to create vectors for each country, and resolution to distinguish them from one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we switched over to the approach the research paper the graphic came from used: pairing each country together (combination rather than permutation, since the pairing is not directional and order thus does not matter) and counting the number of times they \"agree,\" or vote the same way, on resolutions within each five year period. Each Y/Y or N/N pairing is counted as an agreement on an issue; A/A or NP/NP were not counted as it is difficult to determine the exact reason a country may have abstained or been absent from a vote. \n",
    "\n",
    "We store the results of these pairings in an 2D adjacency matrix; we create one for each five year period. The matrix has dimensions n x n for the n countries that existed for the whole 5 year period. The matrix is represented as a lower trangular matrix so there are no repeat values for a country pairing; this is done to save time in the computation. Each cell contains the inverse of the number of times the countries \"agreed\" on a resolution in the period, so that when we plot the data countries that vote similarly are closer together, and vice versa.\n",

    "At this point, we had essentially run out of time while trying to graph each matrix. We had intended on displaying a series of graphs that visualized the change in voting blocs over time, similar to the one in the paper that inspired the project. While displaying the graph, however, we had a difficult time determining what specific graph layout was best for our plot, and how to customize the graphs to make the data easiest to read and understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "In graphs dated before 1993, we would highlight the United States and the Sovet Union, and after 1993 would highlight the US, Russia, and (the People's Republic of) China. The Soviet Union fell at the end of 1991, so we would expect voting blocs to be centered around the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union, we would expect countries voting around Russia to scatter somewhat, or reconverge around other smaller countries or alliances, and as China rose we would expect new voting blocs to reconverge around the PRC.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also want to plot centrality. While we hadn't determined a measure of centrality to use yet, the way we would test our hypothesis is through how similar the most central countries are to the US, Russia, Soviet Union, and China depending on the time frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we were wrapping up, we would want to determine how abstentions, absences, and countries not existing played into how accurate out results are to test for robustness. We would do this by imputing our data and seeing if the results from different imputations agreed with the results we gathered from not including the data initially. \n",

    "If we were to continue to refine the project, there are several things we'd like to do to either meet goals had initially and did not complete, or refine the project to fix an error we realized later in the project would pose an issue. Some of these may be listed above, but are restated here to provide a concise and compact list for future use. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Incomplete Goals\n",
    "* include abstentions and absenses in the error calculation for each plot to more accurately represent the accuracy of each plot\n",
    "* do a frequency analysis on abstentions and absenses over time, so that we can determine which countries abstain or are absent the most, and later analyze any patterns we find\n",
    "* we countries that were not a part of the UN for the each five year period. In the future we would like to use imputation to discover if and/or how the inclusion of countries who joined after the period began affects the outcome of this study.\n",

    "### Errors\n",
    "* When determining which categories to use, we excluded all resolutions involving international peacekeeping, security, and weapons as most countries are likely to vote the same way and including this data may neutralize other data in some sense. However, some of the data we included in this category, and excluded from our dataset, are resolutions supporting or antagolizing certain countries in terms of war or international peackeeping situations, which may be relevant to our dataset and to our analysis. Although the resolution to this error is relatively simple, it would take several hours and the issue was found relatively late in the project cycle; we did not have enough time to execute the solution.\n",
    "* instead of manually determining the categories we wanted to use, it would be nice to somehow figure out which committees each resolution originated from and use those as deterministic factors. This method would be more consistent than relying on our own knowledge and research of each resolution. \n",
    "* in our code when reading in data, we assume that the file has already been created. To generalize this and make it accessible to anyone who wants to run this code from scratch, we would to make checks for this to see if the file has been created yet before reading it in. "
